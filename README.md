This is a simple python app for solving the puzzle - **4 pics 1 word**
However the app does not give the correct answer but rather probabilities 
of the answer based on the following factors:
1. **The LENGTH of the word**
```
The longer the word the less the higher the probability of returning the 
exact word. The reverse is true.
```

2. **The number of VOWELS given as the input**
```
The more the number of vowels, the lower the probability returning the exact 
word. The reverse is true. However, the correct result will be in the list of outputs.
```
**Running the application**
```
Clone this repo to your local machine then change directory to this repo,
then run the app using the python command on the terminal. ie:
```
* cd 4pics_1word
* python solver.py

**Output from the user's input**
